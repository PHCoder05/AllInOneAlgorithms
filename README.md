## Minimum Cost Spanning Tree

### Kruskal's Algorithm
- **Description**: Finds the Minimum Spanning Tree for a connected undirected graph by sorting the edges and adding them one by one.
- **Usage**: See `kruskal.py`.

### Prim's Algorithm
- **Description**: Builds the Minimum Spanning Tree by starting from a vertex and expanding the tree by adding the minimum edge connecting the tree to a vertex outside it.
- **Usage**: See `prim.py`.

## Sorting Algorithms

### Merge Sort
- **Description**: A divide and conquer algorithm that sorts an array by dividing it into halves, sorting them, and merging them back.
- **Usage**: See `merge_sort.py`.

### Quick Sort
- **Description**: An efficient sorting algorithm that uses a pivot to partition the array and recursively sort the partitions.
- **Usage**: See `quick_sort.py`.

## Dynamic Programming

### Bellman-Ford Algorithm
- **Description**: Computes the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.
- **Usage**: See `bellman_ford.py`.

### Traveling Salesman Problem (Dynamic Programming)
- **Description**: Solves the TSP using dynamic programming to find the shortest possible route that visits each city once and returns to the origin city.
- **Usage**: See `tsp_dynamic.py`.

## Divide and Conquer

### Maximum and Minimum in an Array
- **Description**: Finds the maximum and minimum elements in an array using a divide and conquer strategy.
- **Usage**: See `max_min.py`.

## Backtracking

### N-Queens Problem
- **Description**: Solves the N-Queens problem using backtracking, placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
- **Usage**: See `n_queens.py`.

## Branch and Bound

### Traveling Salesman Problem (Branch and Bound)
- **Description**: Solves the TSP using branch and bound techniques to find the optimal solution.
- **Usage**: See `tsp_branch_bound.py`.
